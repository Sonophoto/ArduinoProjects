### ArduinoProjects
A collection of original, GPL licensed, Arduino projects that may be of interest for robotics and sensors projects

I only really use Arduino Mega 2560s because they have interrupts and hardware serial. Because of this you may need a Mega to run some of these projects. It may be possible to adapt them to Unos and others but that is left as an exercise as they say. Also note that some sensors may use an abridged interface and do not give complete access to all of the sensors features. I will try to point out any libraries that implement all chip/sensor features in these cases.

Each directory is a stand alone project or library. Some may really be a gist with a single function or interrupt service routine (ISR)

Some projects may require you to install other (3rd party) libraries before they will compile and run.

These are living projects, I will accept pulls that fit the stated purrpose, fix any bugs if they get reported, and be thrilled to have you fork this repo and use it to create something entirely different.
